iScillator is a comprehensive hardware-software device for generating broadband therapeutic oscillations based on the principles of Georges Lakhovsky's Multi-Wave Oscillator (MWO).

## üìã Description

The device consists of two main components:
- **Hardware**: High-voltage pulse generator based on modified Tesla coil and resonant antenna system (Lakhovsky antenna)
- **Software**: Cross-platform Flutter application SoundHealer for frequency and waveform control

## üî¨ Operating Principle

iScillator generates alternating high-voltage fields with a broad frequency spectrum through:
- Tesla transformer providing high alternating voltage (tens to hundreds of kilovolts)
- Concentric resonant rings of various diameters (Lakhovsky antenna)
- Creation of broadband harmonic fields to activate natural cellular oscillations

## ‚ö° Technical Features

### Hardware
- **Generator**: Modified solid-state Tesla Coil (SSTC)
- **Antenna**: System of concentric metallic rings of different diameters
- **Power Supply**: Exclusively battery-powered (12-30V with step-up to tens of kV)
- **Safety**: Automatic disconnection from mains power during operation
- **Spark Gaps**: Special solid mercury spark gaps
- **Coil**: Modified with separate circuits (unlike standard automotive ignition coils)

### Software
- **Platforms**: Android, iOS (Flutter)
- **Audio Engine**: AudioKit for iOS
- **Features**:
  - Tone generation with smooth frequency changes (glissando)
  - Wide range of waveforms (sine, sawtooth, square, triangle)
  - Frequency preset system (Solfeggio, chakra frequencies)
  - User settings storage

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Assembly

### Application Requirements
- Flutter SDK
- Xcode (for iOS)
- Android Studio (for Android)

### Application Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iScillator/iScillator-app.git
cd iScillator-app/app
flutter pub get
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Android

## üîå Connecting to Application

### Connection Methods

#### 1. Audio Channel (Simple)
- Connect smartphone audio output to device input via 3.5mm jack
- Application generates sound oscillations at required frequency

#### 2. Wireless Connection (Advanced)
- Use Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module based on ESP32
- Application transmits commands wirelessly
- Microcontroller controls frequency and signal shape

## üì± Usage

1. Launch iScillator application on smartphone
2. Select desired frequency or preset (e.g., "174 Hz ‚Äì Muladhara")
3. Press play button ‚ñ∂
4. Position radiator a few centimeters from subject
5. Conduct session for 5-30 minutes

### Example with Presets
```

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Measures

- **WARNING**: Device operates with high voltages (tens of kV)
- Use battery power only
- Avoid touching device during operation
- Ensure reliable insulation of all components
- Recommended to bring your own discharged battery to sessions
- Device automatically disconnects from mains power during operation

## üîã Power Supply Features

- **Batteries Only**: Device operates exclusively on battery power
- **Automatic Disconnection**: Switch disconnects device from mains during operation
- **Charging**: Mains power used only for battery charging in standby mode
- **Recommendation**: Use your own discharged battery to avoid influence of electronic entities

## üìö Theoretical Foundations

### Lakhovsky Technologies
- **Multi-Wave Oscillator (MWO)**: Classic "frequency spiral"
- **Cellular Oscillation**: Hypothesis of bioresonance under RF field exposure
- **Resonant Oscillations**: Activation of natural healthy cell oscillations
